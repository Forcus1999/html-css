<h2 style="text-align: color: ;color: #110edd;">ACT 1</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: color: ;color: #110edd;">PROLOGUE</h2><br>

Two households, both alike in dignity,<br> 
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br> 
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br> 
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br> 
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br> 
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br> 
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br> 
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br> 
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br> 
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br> 
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br> 
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br> 
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br> 
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br> 

<h2 style="color: #110edd;">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h2><br>
<p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>
<br>

Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.<br>

<h2 style="color: #110edd; font-weight: bold;">GREGORY</h2><br>

No, for then we should be <span style="color: rgb(70, 230, 21);">colliers.</span>
